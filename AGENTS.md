## Core Mantra

- Convention-first, explicit only for ambiguity.
- Parent relationship inference is the default behavior.
- `parentRelationship` is required only when multiple parent relationships are valid candidates.
- Payload semantics are strict:
- absent key => ignore (no mutation)
- explicit `null` => clear/delete

## Development Process (Strict TDD)

- Always work test-first.
- For any behavior change or bug fix:
- write or update tests first
- run tests to confirm they fail for the expected reason
- only then implement code to make tests pass
- If API surface is missing, add the smallest API needed to express the test first.
- Do not write implementation first and then backfill tests.
- Prefer regression tests that pin behavior at the public API boundary.
- After implementation, run relevant targeted tests and then broader suite as needed.

## Implementation Guidance

- Keep changes minimal and behavior-driven.
- Avoid inferring behavior from implementation details in tests; test expected contract.
- Keep diagnostics explicit and actionable when behavior cannot be resolved safely.
